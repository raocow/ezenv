# rigorish: auto-activate the nearest .venv when you cd into a project.
#
# The current directory is the source of truth: cd into a tree that contains
# a .venv and it activates; leave every .venv scope and whatever is active is
# deactivated — including a venv activated elsewhere (e.g. auto-activated by
# your editor). So the venv that's live always matches where you are.
#
# Enable by adding to ~/.zshrc:
#   source "$(brew --prefix)/share/rigorish/autovenv.zsh"
